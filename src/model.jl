## Joint model for the Epuyén ANDV outbreak: incubation period, per-pair
## transmission timing relative to source onset, and time-varying reproduction
## number.
##
## Three quantities estimated together from the line list:
##
##   1. Incubation period           — LogNormal(μ_inc, σ_inc), from each case's
##                                    exposure-window-to-onset gap.
##   2. Transmission timing δ       — Normal(μ_δ, σ_δ), the gap between a
##                                    secondary's infection time and its
##                                    source's symptom onset. Identified
##                                    per-pair from the line list.
##   3. Time-varying reproduction   — log R(t) is a random walk on weekly
##      number                        knot values, linearly interpolated between
##                                    knots so R(t) is continuous in t.
##                                    Negative-Binomial offspring (dispersion k).
##
## Each case has continuous latents: an infection time T_inf and an onset time
## T_onset. Interval-censored onsets and exposure dates are handled by
## Bayesian data augmentation over these latents.
##
## The generation interval and serial interval are derived in post-processing
## from δ and Inc. The per-pair constraint T_inf[secondary] > T_inf[source]
## is enforced via a -Inf reject in the likelihood to ensure GI > 0.
